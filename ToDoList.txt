#!ToDoList.txt

Features:
* Prettily-formatted devices list, rather than raw Python list for cmd "devs"
* Finish off rules - make sure various actions work
* Rename event.SECONDS to event.TICK to avoid confusion
* Implement timeout after 2(?) seconds for AT command sending
* Setup reporting for temperature

Bugs
* Get event.SECONDS for devices polling working - at the moment this doesn't work, so that new devices aren't properly setup while they're polling after join
