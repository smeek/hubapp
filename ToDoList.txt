Features:
* Multiple device ZigBee endpoints?
* Web interface(!)
* Battery checking on a daily basis.  Ought to email if too low
* Ask for battery percentage once/day, rather than use reporting?
* Need a timed event (eg midday every day) to remove cached battery percentage, thus forcing re-request at next CheckIn
* Timed rules for Smartplugs, etc.
# *** Burglar alarm? ***
# Need variable for "armed" state
# Allow for grace period after arming
# Need to see if 2nd sensor has fired shortly after first sensor to avoid false alarms
# Need easy means of going into Armed / Disarmed mode (keyfob, smartphone
# Probably need multi-line code blocks, { ... }
